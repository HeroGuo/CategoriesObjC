/*!
 @brief    Guts of an action method for a "Save As Move..."
 item in the "File" menu, which also allows setting the
 initial directory in the dialog

 @details  Presents a dialog which allows the user to 
 move the receiver's file to a new path, deleting the
 old file, then if the user responds affirmatively,
 invokes -saveMoveToNewUrl:error_p.
 
 In the dialog presented to the user, unless overidden
 by a non-nil parameter, the small text at the
 top ("message"), the text to the left of the filename
 text field ("label") and the text on the default button
 ("prompt") may be defined by implementing one or more of
 the methods in the NSPersistentDocumentMoveToStringer
 informal protocol in the receiver.
 
 Suggested tooltip for such a "Save As Move..." menu item:
 "This is like 'Save As...', except your document file will
 also be removed from its current name/location."
 
 @param    directory  path to the directory which will
 be initially shown in the dialog.
 @param    message  If not nil, in the dialog presented to
 the user, the string passed here will override the string
 returned by -saveAsMoveMessage and will appear as the
 the small text at the top, as in -[NSSavePanel setMessage:].
 @param    doneInvocation  An invocation which will be
 invoked after the operation has either been cancelled or
 completed.  May be nil.
